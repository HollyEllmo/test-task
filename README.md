This is fullStack Next.js project.
If you wish, you can repeat the main functionality on any other Node.js framework.

First try npm i
Then then enter npm run dev
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

All .env variables already, but you need to deploy your own PostgreSQL in Docker and put link to it in DATABASE_URL in .env file.

I hope you won't abuse my keys :)
